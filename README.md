## OTA and detector blocks
 This design contains an envelope detector. This block is formed by an nfet_01V8 transistor and an RC filter. 
 The design implementation was based on the repository [caravel_user_project_analog](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog.git). 




Refer to [README](docs/source/index.rst) for this sample project documentation.
